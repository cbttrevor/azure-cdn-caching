## Learning Objective

You can provision an Azure Redis Cache using the Microsoft Azure Portal web interface.
Once you provision a Redis Cache, you'll need to configure the TLS version that's used to encrypt the connection.
To further secure an Azure Redis Cache, you can configure firewall rules to whitelist certain IP addresses.

Provisioning a Redis Cache can take quite some time, so be patient while it's working.
